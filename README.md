# Adaptive-and-Integrated-Text-Mining-for-Assessing-MOOC-using-Vector-Space-Model
There has been a surge in the popularity of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) courses in recent years. People independent of age group use this form of learning to augment their knowledge in their required field and have a large collection of courses to choose from. Though the variety of courses and the number of courses to choose from is high this availability of a large number of courses for a particular topic also poses a problem to the learners on which course to choose from. This platform also provides a possibility for the learners to share their reviews which helps other learners decide whether to select the course or not based on the reviews of the previous learners. Research has been done to evaluate the courses based on the reviews but as the number of reviews increases the existing model and some research methods might give ambiguous results.  This Project proposes a novel approach that utilizes text-based reviews to score the courses by incorporating ANN and archives an accuracy of 90 %.
